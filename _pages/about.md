I am going to obtain my BEng degree with the College of Intelligent System, Shenzhen, China, in 2025, under the guidance of [Shimin Gong](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=AKffc_QAAAAJ&hl=en) in WinsLab.
I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. program in Singapore.

My research is primarily centered around DRL based secure transmission, vehicular network and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) in wireless communication.
