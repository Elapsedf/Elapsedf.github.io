I am currently a Ph.D. student from the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.coe.miami.edu/index.html), University of Miami, under the supervision of [Mingzhe Chen](https://winslab.us/). I received my BEng degree from the College of Intelligent System, Shenzhen, Sun Yat-sen University, China, in 2025, under the guidance of [Shimin Gong](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=AKffc_QAAAAJ&hl=en) in WinsLab.

My research is primarily centered around but not limited to real-time optimization, machine learning, UAV, and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) in wireless communication and semantic communication. Welcome to any collaboration, and feel free to reach out to me!
