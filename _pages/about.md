I am going to obtain my BEng degree with the College of Intelligent System, Shenzhen, China, in 2025, under the guidance of [Shimin Gong](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=AKffc_QAAAAJ&hl=en) in WinsLab.
I will go to the University of Miami to pursue a Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [Mingzhe Chen](https://winslab.us/).

My research is primarily centered around but not limited to real-time optimization, machine learning, UAV, and AI-Generated Content (AIGC) in wireless communication and semantic communication.
I am also open to cooperate with anyone who
